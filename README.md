# Finished-Projects

This is a collection of my projects throughout school as well as personal projects to showcase my growth as a programmer.

Project Descriptions:


Project4Rivelli:

Description:
This Java program calculates a performance score for a computer based on its GPU clock speed, CPU clock speed, number of CPU cores, monitor resolution, and overclocking capability.
Based on the score, it recommends the optimal graphics quality for gaming or other performance-intensive tasks.

Key Features:
Prompts the user to enter hardware specifications (GPU, CPU, cores, monitor resolution).
Validates user input to ensure realistic hardware values.
Calculates a performance score using a weighted formula.
Provides a recommended graphics quality setting (Ultra, Medium, Low, etc.).
Allows multiple computers to be entered and calculates the average performance score.

Usage:
Run the program in a Java IDE or from the command line.
Follow the prompts to enter your computer’s hardware specifications.
View the recommended graphics quality for your system.



MiniRpgSim:
Description:
This program is a simple text-based RPG simulator created to help beginner Java students practice programming concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- Methods and static context
- Loops (while loops for game flow)
- Conditionals (if/else statements for decision making)
- Randomization with the Random class
- User input with Scanner
- Basic game mechanics (health, attack, defense, and turn-based combat)
- Simple chance-based mechanics (healing, blocking, ultimate abilities)

Gameplay Overview:
- Players choose a character with preset stats or a randomized character.
- The player faces a randomly spawned enemy (mob) from a set of predefined mobs.
- Battles are turn-based: the player chooses to attack, heal (chance-based), block (chance-based), or use an ultimate ability (chance-based).
- Each enemy has different stats (health, attack, defense) and can deal damage to the player.
- Upon defeating a mob, the player gains a small health bonus and automatically encounters another enemy.
- The game continues until the player's health reaches zero.

Learning Goals:
- Practice working with methods and passing data in a single-class program.
- Understand the concept of static variables and methods.
- Implement randomization and probability in game mechanics.
- Develop logical thinking and problem-solving through simple turn-based gameplay.
- Organize and structure code in a readable, maintainable way.
